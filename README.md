KYVE, the Web3 data lake solution, is a protocol that enables data providers to standardize, validate, and permanently store blockchain data streams. By leveraging permanent data storage solutions like Arweave, KYVEâ€™s Cosmos SDK chain creates permanent backups and ensures the scalability, immutability, and availability of these resources over time.

## Project Overview

**Common:**

- [@kyvejs/types](common/types/README.md) - holds all types for the KYVE application in typescript
- [@kyvejs/sdk](common/sdk/README.md) - development kit for communicating with the KYVE blockchain
- [@kyvejs/protocol](common/protocol/README.md) - core functionality for running validators on the KYVE network
- [@kyvejs/docker](common/docker/README.md) - core functionality facilitating dockerising KYVE functionality and communicating with dockerised runtimes via gRPC

**Tools:**

- [@kyvejs/kysor](tools/kysor/README.md) - The Cosmovisor of KYVE

**Integrations:**

- [@kyvejs/tendermint](integrations/tendermint/README.md) - The official KYVE Tendermint sync integration
- [@kyvejs/tendermint-bsync](integrations/tendermint-bsync/README.md) - The official KYVE Tendermint block sync integration
- [@kyvejs/tendermint-ssync](integrations/tendermint-ssync/README.md) - The official KYVE Tendermint block sync integration

## Build Integration Binaries

Clone and checkout repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KYVENetwork/kyvejs.git
cd kyvejs
```

Checkout desired version:

```
git checkout tags/@kyvejs/<integration>@x.x.x -b @kyvejs/<integration>@x.x.x
```

Example: `git checkout tags/@kyvejs/tendermint-bsync@1.0.0 -b @kyvejs/tendermint-bsync@1.0.0`

Install dependencies and setup project:

```
yarn setup
```

Checkout integration and build binaries:

```
cd integrations/<integration>
yarn build:binaries
```

The binaries can then be found in the `/out` folder

## Dockerized Execution

In the Kyve project, the binaries can now be easily executed within a Docker container. This allows for simplified deployment and consistent runtime environments. Before running the Kyve binaries in a Docker container, please ensure that you have set up a Docker network. If you haven't already, you can create a Docker network using the following command:

```
docker network create --driver bridge kyve
```

**Building the Docker Image**

To build a Docker image for Kyve Core, you can use the provided Dockerfile. Use the following command to build the image, while being in the root directory:

```
docker build -t kyve-core -f Dockerfile .
```

**Running Kyve Core in a Docker Container**

Once you have built the Docker image, you can run Kyve Core in a Docker container. Below are the instructions for running Kyve Core as a node:

1. Set your recovery phrase as the VALACCOUNT environment variable:

```
export VALACCOUNT="<recovery phrase>"
```

2. Run the Kyve Core container, replacing the placeholders with your specific parameters:

```
docker run --rm --name kyve-core --network kyve -e VALACCOUNT=$VALACCOUNT kyve-core ./kyve start --pool <pool id> --valaccount "$VALACCOUNT" --cache memory --rpc <rpc address> --rest <rest address> --chain-id=<chain id> --request-backoff 50 --debug
```
- `<recovery phrase>`: Replace this with your recovery phrase.
- `<pool id>`: Specify the pool ID you want to join.
- `<rpc address>`: Provide the RPC address of the network.
- `<rest address>`: Provide the REST API address.
- `<chain id>`: Specify the chain ID you want to interact with.

**Development and Testing**

For development and testing purposes, you can also run specific runtime methods in the Dockerized Kyve Core. Here's how to do it:

Run the Kyve Core container for a specific runtime method and arguments:
```
docker run --rm --name kyve-core --network kyve kyve-core ./kyve runtime <method> <args>
```
- `<method>`: Replace this with the name of the runtime method you want to test.
- `<args>`: Provide any required arguments for the runtime method.

By following these instructions, you can easily dockerize and run Kyve Core and perform testing and development tasks. The Dockerized runtime provides a convenient and isolated environment for your Kyve project.






## How to contribute

Checkout new branch to implement new features/fixes there

```bash
git checkout -b [feat/fix]/[my-branch-name]
```

Install dependencies and setup project:

```bash
yarn setup
```

Apply your changes and create a Pull Request to `main`. Once the team has
reviewed and approved your PR it can be merged and used.

**NOTE**: The usage of [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) is required when creating PRs and committing to this repository

## How to release

In order to release new changes which got merged into `main` lerna can be used. Lerna will look into every change and create a new release tag if necessary. After the user has approved the new version tags (bumped according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)) lerna will push those new tags to `main`, starting the CI/CD pipeline and creating the releases.

Release with lerna:

```
yarn lerna version
```
